        <p>I am a <em>foodie</em> and love to cook often. While coming to my favorite food, I vote to <strong>The Samosa</strong>, the favorite snack to almost every Indian. To prepare this recipe we can refer to the below mentioned ingredients and procedure.</p>
        <p>I love samosa because of the <em>crispy outer layer</em> and the <em>super hot stuffing</em> inside it. It was even little easy to cook.</p>

            <li>Take a bowl and add 2 cups of maida flour in it, add some Ajwain seeds to the flour and add little water to it to knead into a smooth dough.</li>
            <li>Now keep the bowl aside undisturbed for some time.üïë</li>
            <li>Now boil 3 to 4 potatoes and some green peas in another bowl.</li>
            <li>Now take a pan and turn on the stove and place this pan on the flame.üî•</li>
            <li>Now peel of the skin of the boiled potatoes and chop some onions and chillies.</li>
            <li>Now add some oil in the pan and add some Cumin seeds to it and add chopped onions and chillies in the oil and also add boiled peas and the smashed potatoes in the oil.üç≥</li>
            <li>Now add some chilli powder, turmeric powder and salt and mix the curry well and keep it aside.üë®‚Äçüç≥</li>
            <li>After the curry cools down, take a hand full of maida dough and make it as a ball and prepare it like a roti and cut the roti into two equal halfs.</li>
            <li>Now take the half part of the roti dough into the hand and roll it to make a cone like structure.</li>
            <li>Now stuff the curry into the cone and apply some water to the tail of the cone, the opened corners, and press the opened corners of the cone to make it a closed one.</li>
            <li>Repeat the same process for the remaining half parts of the roti dough.</li>
            <li>Now take a pan and add enough amount of oil in it for the deep fry.üë©‚Äçüç≥</li>
            <li>After the oil gets heated place 2 to 3 curry stuffed samosas in the oil and deep fry those till it turns into golden brown color.</li>
            <li>Serve the fried samosas in a plate.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The cooked or fried Samosas will be in the Golden Brown color with amazing mouth watery fragnance and tasteüòã. I am sure that you will mesmerize with the taste of these crispy samosas. The favorite Indian snack <strong>Samosa</strong> is ready. You can serve it with <strong>Pudina Chutney</strong>, the best combination for the Samosas.üç¥</p>
